CAF based AOSP for Moto G4 (Athene)
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CAF AOSP trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/Nougat-Athene/platform_manifest.git -b LA.BR.1.3.6_rb1.3

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
